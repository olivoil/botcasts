**Hotwire-powered Podcast Player** 🔌

This course works by introducing a series of failing tests that you must get to
pass by introducing Hotwire patterns into the application.

For more Hotwire resources, check out our [blog posts].

## ⚙️  Setup

If this is your first time running the application, run `./bin/setup` to
install dependencies and seed the database.

If you run into a `Tailwindcss::Commands::ExecutableNotFoundException: Cannot find the
tailwindcss executable` error, you need to add your platform to `Gemfile.lock`. See \
[this Stack Overflow] for more details.
